# D-Swipe
The D-Swipe project has been created to build NFT-Shirts on the NEAR blockchain. The concept is to allow shoppers and sellers to have an easy to use wholesome experience when using Web3 to transact. 

The contents of this repository are work in progress as we look at how to create innovative decentralized commerce experiences where ease of use and disintermediation is the order of the day. 

The idea is to create a NEAR blockchain based store that sells one of a kind T-shirts that are tagged with an NFT basically and NFT-shirt. The store would be totally decentralized for both adding and removing products as well as for customers making purchases. The store would not hold an inventory of pre-minted NFT-Shirts. Merchandise would be minted for each specific customer with customisations and variations that ensure the work is unique. Every design would need to incorporate a visible QR code and hash which can be verified at the store site. The QR could also provide links to information on the particular design, concept, motivation, designer(s) and so on. Each T-shirt comes with 1 NEAR which is locked in a compounding DeFi pool for a 5 year period after which the owner at that date can release the value.
